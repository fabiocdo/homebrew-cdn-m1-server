## What Maintainers Can Do

- Review project-owned resources/channels and remove violating references when applicable.
- Close/limit project support for clearly abusive integrations.
- Request additional evidence before acting.
- Act only within project-controlled channels/resources.

## Scope Limitation

Project maintainers do not control third-party/private self-hosted instances.
For those cases, reports must be directed to the instance operator, host provider,
or relevant legal channel.
- Maintainers are not legally responsible for third-party instance content or operations.
- Maintainers do not provide proactive monitoring of external/self-hosted deployments.

## Repeat Abuse

Repeated abuse in project channels may result in blocked communication and
contribution restrictions.
